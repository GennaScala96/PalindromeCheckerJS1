# PalindromeCheckerJS1
First JS project I'm sharing here on gitHub, knowledge is getting stronger.. 



For this project I've been working a lot from many teachers I've found along the web. Not so surprisingly JS is a big language and pretty hard for someone at its first steps but I've been trough it patiently and solved all the obstacles during the journey.
What we have here? Here I present my first JS project: a palindrome checker. Utents can choose a word, or challenge themselves with a whole sentence, input it in the given blank space and: after a simple submission on the button "check" the website will show them if the input is a palindrome or not.

Note: symbols and Upper cases are not counted in this project, for example: input: _Eye  output: _Eye is a palindrome
input:  ---.--- output: ---.--- is a palidrome

Note2: if the input is null (the blank space remains blank and no input is given) and we press "check", an alert will appear telling us to insert a value.
